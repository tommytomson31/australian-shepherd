        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the Heritage Hill Aussies website, contacting us regarding a puppy, or purchasing a puppy from us, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use our website or services.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-content__section">
        <h2>2. Puppy Sales &amp; Deposits</h2>
        <p>A non-refundable deposit is required to reserve a puppy from an upcoming or current litter. The deposit amount will be communicated at the time of reservation and will be applied toward the total purchase price.</p>
        <p>The remaining balance is due in full before the puppy is released to the buyer. Puppies will not be released until full payment has been received and confirmed.</p>
        <p>Heritage Hill Aussies reserves the right to refuse any sale if we determine, at our sole discretion, that the placement may not be a suitable fit for the puppy. In such cases, any deposit paid will be refunded in full.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-content__section">
        <h2>3. Health Guarantee</h2>
        <p>All Heritage Hill Aussies puppies are sold with a health guarantee. Each puppy will have received age-appropriate vaccinations, deworming, and a veterinary health examination prior to leaving our care.</p>
        <p>The buyer is required to have the puppy examined by a licensed veterinarian within 72 hours of pickup or delivery. Failure to do so may void the health guarantee.</p>
        <p>The health guarantee may be voided under the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Failure to obtain a veterinary examination within the required 72-hour window</li>
          <li>Neglect, abuse, or failure to provide proper care, nutrition, and veterinary attention</li>
          <li>Injuries resulting from accidents, mishandling, or interactions with other animals</li>
          <li>Illnesses resulting from exposure to environments or animals prior to completion of the full vaccination series</li>
          <li>Failure to follow the recommended vaccination and care schedule provided at the time of sale</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Specific details of the health guarantee, including duration and coverage, will be outlined in the individual puppy sales contract provided at the time of purchase.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-content__section">
        <h2>4. AKC Registration</h2>
        <p>All Heritage Hill Aussies puppies are sold with American Kennel Club (AKC) limited registration. Limited registration means the dog is registered with the AKC but no litters produced by the dog are eligible for registration.</p>
        <p>Full AKC registration may be available on a case-by-case basis and is subject to discussion and approval by Heritage Hill Aussies. Additional terms and fees may apply for full registration privileges.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-content__section">
        <h2>5. Spay/Neuter Agreement</h2>
        <p>All puppies sold on limited registration are required to be spayed or neutered by the age recommended by your veterinarian, typically between six months and one year of age, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by Heritage Hill Aussies.</p>
        <p>Proof of spay/neuter may be requested and should be provided to Heritage Hill Aussies upon completion. Failure to comply with this agreement may result in forfeiture of the health guarantee and any registration papers.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-content__section">
        <h2>6. Return Policy</h2>
        <p>If at any point you are unable to keep your Heritage Hill Aussies puppy or dog, you must contact us before rehoming the animal. We are committed to the lifelong welfare of every puppy we produce and want to ensure each dog is placed in a safe, loving home.</p>
        <p>Puppies and dogs from Heritage Hill Aussies may not be resold, surrendered to a shelter, or transferred to a third party without prior written approval from Heritage Hill Aussies. We reserve the right to reclaim any dog that is found to be in an unsuitable living situation.</p>
        <p>Heritage Hill Aussies will make every reasonable effort to assist in rehoming or, when possible, accept the dog back into our care.</p>
