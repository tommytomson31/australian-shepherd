          <span class="section__label">How It All Began</span>
          <h2 class="section__title">A Love That Started With One Aussie</h2>
          <p>Over fifteen years ago, our family welcomed our very first Australian Shepherd into our home. We had no plans to become breeders. We simply fell in love with the intelligence, loyalty, and boundless energy that defines this remarkable breed. That first Aussie changed everything for us. She became our constant companion, our children's best friend, and the spark that ignited a lifelong passion.</p>
          <p>What started as a single dog quickly grew into something much larger. Friends and family couldn't help but notice the incredible temperament and beauty of our Aussies, and before long, we were fielding requests from people who wanted a puppy just like ours. We knew that if we were going to bring more of these wonderful dogs into the world, we would do it the right way.</p>
          <p>Heritage Hill Aussies was founded on one unwavering principle: every single dog in our care is a member of our family first. We are not a kennel. We are not a puppy mill. We are a family who shares our home, our lives, and our hearts with our dogs. Every breeding decision we make is guided by a deep respect for the breed standard, a commitment to genetic health, and a genuine love for each individual dog.</p>
          <p>Today, our breeding program is recognized for producing Australian Shepherds of exceptional quality, temperament, and health. We take immense pride in the families we've matched with our puppies over the years, and we remain dedicated to raising each litter with the same care and devotion that started this journey.</p>
